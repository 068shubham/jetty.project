=== Jetty Logging Integrations (SLF4J, Log4j, Logback, JCL, JUL)

Jetty provides support for several logging frameworks including SLF4J, Java Commons Logging (JCL), Java Util Logging (JUL), Log4j (including version 2), and Logback.
This page includes examples of how to enable the associated modules for these different frameworks.
These modules are designed to capture container/server logs; link:#configuring-jetty-request-logs[request logs] and application logs need to be configured separately.
Please note that enabling these modules provides typical and basic functionality for each framework; advanced implementations may require their link:#startup-modules[own modules] or additional configuration.

Enabling these frameworks in the Jetty distribution is as easy as activating any other module, by adding `--add-to-start=<module name>` to the start command for your server, such as:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
[my-base]$ java -jar ../start.jar --add-to-start=logging-jetty
INFO : logging-jetty   initialized in ${jetty.base}/start.d/logging-jetty.ini
INFO : resources       transitive
INFO : Base directory was modified
....

As noted above, Jetty supports a wide array of logging technologies.
If a particular logging framework requires additional jar files, Jetty will automatically download these as part of enabling the associated module and any dependent modules will be transitively enabled.

A list of the base Jetty logging modules by running `java -jar <path-to-jetty.home>/start.jar --list-modules=logging,-internal`.

logging-jcl::
Configures Jetty logging to use Java Commons Logging (JCL), using SLF4J as a binding.
logging-jetty::
Standard Jetty logging that captures `System.err` and `System.out` output.
logging-jul::
Configures Jetty logging to use Java Util Logging (JUL), using SLF4J as a binding.
logging-log4j::
Configures Jetty logging to use Log4j as the logging implementation, using SLF4J as a binding.
logging-log4j2::
Configures Jetty logging to use Log4j2 as the logging implementation, using SLF4J as a binding.
logging-logback::
Configures Jetty logging to use Logback as the logging implementation, using SLF4J as a binding.
logging-slf4j::
Configures Jetty logging to use SLF4J and provides a `slf4j-impl` which can be used by other logging frameworks.
If no other logging is configured, `slf4j-simple` is used.

You can view a list of *all* the Jetty logging modules by running `java -jar <path-to-jetty.home>/start.jar --list-modules=logging`.
This will display all logging modules, including implementation and binding modules.

All these modules (with the exception of `logging-jetty`) arrange for the Jetty private logging API to be routed to the named technology to actually be logged.
For example, enabling the `logging-log4j` module will do several things:

* it enables an internal Log4j API module so that any container code that uses Log4j will find the API.
* it enables an internal Log4j Implementation so that any container code that uses the Log4j API will also use a Log4j implementation to handle the logs (and all the normal Log4j configuration mechanisms etc.)
* it enables the internal `slf4j-log4j` logging binding so that any container code that uses the SLF4j API to also use the Log4j implementation via the Log4j API.
* it configures the Jetty logging API to use the SLF4J API, which is then bound to Log4j.

So, after enabling `logging-log4j`, within the server container there are 3 logging APIs available: Jetty, SLF4J and Log4J.
But there is only a single logging *implementation* - Log4j; the 3 APIs act only as facades over the Log4j implementation.

Note that you can add additional APIs to this configuration.
For example, enabling the internal module `jcl-slf4j` would add in a Java Commons Logging facade that also would use the Log4j implementation via the SLF4J binding.

Most other top level logging modules work in the same way: `logging-jcl`, `logging-jul`, `logging-slf4j`, `logging-log4j2` and `logging-logback` all bind their implementation via SLF4J.

[[example-logging-slf4j]]
==== Logging with SLF4J

Jetty uses the SLF4J api as a binding to provide logging information to additional frameworks such as Log4j or Logback.
It can also be used on it's own to provide simple server logging.
To enable the SLF4J framework, you need to activate the `logging-slf4j` module.
By default, log files will be stored in `${jetty.base}/logs`.

As you probably noticed, the system gives an `ERROR` when trying to enable the `logging-slf4j` on it's own.
The `logging-slf4j` module itself provides the SLF4J api, but as SLF4J is often used as a binding for other logging frameworks does not by default provide an implementation.
To enable the simple SLF4J implementation, we will also need to activate the `slf4j-simple-impl` module.
