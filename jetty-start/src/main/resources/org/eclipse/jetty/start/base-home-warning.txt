WARNING
-------

While it is possible to run Jetty from within {jetty.home}, 
it is not recommended that you run Jetty this way.

Please setup a proper {jetty.base}.

See http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/startup.html

The demo-base has been provided to you for an example of this kind of setup.

 $ cd demo-base
 $ java -jar ../start.jar
